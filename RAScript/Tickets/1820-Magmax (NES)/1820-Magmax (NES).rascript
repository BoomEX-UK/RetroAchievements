//      This triggered just by reaching the boss with the MagMax. It's possible the other one I reported triggered for that reason as well, and I only thought it was when I got hit because I happened to right when the achievement I got before that one finished displaying. It's... hard to explain, sorry, but basically: these "stage mastered" achievements likely just pop when you get to the boss with the MagMax.
